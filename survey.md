### Original Research

#### What we're doing

We want to uncover using original research why meetups are such as big part of the tech community. We're looking to discover how we can ensure everyone involved, from attendees and organisers to speakers and sponsors, can get the most out of meetups, as well as if lockdown has affected the way the average member of the tech community approaches events. 

We're hopeful this research will prove useful to our community and give us advice on the best ways to help open the doors to potential meetup goers whoâ€™ve never attended an event before.
