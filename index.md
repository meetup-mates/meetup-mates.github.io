Meetup Mates is one of Tecknuovo’s community initiatives. Our mission is a simple one: we want to ensure than tech meetups are open, accessible, and fun for everyone who wants to take part. 

Our community can be found on Slack where we chat, get to know one another and share ideas. You’ll hear about the latest events happening and where Meetup Mates will be next, as well as pre-meets in your area. From an hour before a meetup, we gather at a nearby venue and then attend the Meetup together as a group. 

Founded in London, we’re now setting sail across the country, so look for us at a meetup group near you - the nerve-wracking days of attending meetups alone are over and we look forward to you joining the crew!
